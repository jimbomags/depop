### `npm start`

To start the app enter 'npm start' in the terminal in the folder's directory.

### `npm test`

In regards to testing / preventing errors I have done the following:
  - Built some unit tests to check each component will render
  - Installed eslint to detect errors and enforce a style guide
  - Used PropTypes to check the correct props are being passed to each component

There is still plently of scope for more testing but I didn't want to go crazy

### Notes

The app is fully functional, you can like/unlike each product by clicking on the like icon and show/hide the sold items.

I hope you like what I've built, I've really enjoyed making it.
